# how many continuous errors in each update cycle can the bot accept before it will delete all offers to protect its exposure.
# this number has to be exceeded for all the offers to be deleted and any error will be counted only once per update cycle.

# the bot will continue running even if it hits an error or deletes all offers.
# the typical use case for this config value is to keep the orders on your orderbook intact if your price feed is unreachable for a small amount of time.
# example: use -1 if you never want to delete all offers (this is not recommended).
# example: use 0 if you want to delete all offers on any error.
# example: use 2 if you want to tolerate 2 continuous update cycle with errors, i.e. three continuous update cycles with errors will delete all offers.

# form "https://[hostname]:[MONITORING_PORT]/_googleauth". For testing locally, you can set it to "https://localhost:[PORT]/_googleauth"
