# Sample config file for the "sell" strategy

# We are selling the base asset here, i.e. ASSET_CODE_A as defined in the trader config

# Price Feeds
# Note: we take the value from the A feed and divide it by the value retrieved from the B feed below.
# the type of feeds can be one of crypto, fiat, fixed, exchange, sdex.

# specification of feed type "exchange"
DATA_TYPE_A="exchange"
# the specification of the A feed
# the format is <exchange name>/<base-asset-code-defined-by-exchange>/<quote-asset-code-defined-by-exchange>/<modifier>
# exchange name:
#     use "kraken" or any of the ccxt-exchanges (run `kelp exchanges` for full list)
#     examples: "kraken", "ccxt-kraken", "ccxt-binance", "ccxt-poloniex", "ccxt-bittrex"
# base asset code defined by exchange:
#     this is the asset code defined by the exchange for the asset whose price you want to fetch (base asset).
#     this code can be retrieved from the exchange's website or from the ccxt manual for ccxt-based exchanges.
# quote asset code defined by exchange:
#     this is the asset code defined by the exchange for asset in which you want to quote the price (quote asset).
#     this code can be retrieved from the exchange's website or from the ccxt manual for ccxt-based exchanges.
# modifier:
#     this is a modifier that can be included only for feed type "exchange".
#     a modifier allows you to fetch the "mid" price, "ask" price, "bid" price, or "last" price for now.
#     if left unspecified then this is defaulted to "mid" for backwards compatibility (until v2.0 is released) (LOH-2)
# uncomment below to use binance, poloniex, or bittrex as your price feed. You will need to set up CCXT to use this, see the "Using CCXT" section in the README for details.
# be careful about using USD vs. USDT since some exchanges support only one, or both, or in some cases neither.

# sample priceFeed with the "sdex" type
# this feed pulls from the SDEX, you can use the asset you're trading or something else, like the same coin from another issuer
# DATA_TYPE_A = "sdex"
